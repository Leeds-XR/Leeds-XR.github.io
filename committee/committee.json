		"bio": "My name is Anna Goldson, I’m a 2nd year Art and Design student from just North West of London. When I was about 8 years old, I used to imagine myself drawing in the air with a magical set of markers. Little did I know back then, that many years later this dream would come true, that I would be able to use applications such as Tilt Brush to draw in 3D! <br> Since the first time I experienced VR, I have known that this was the path for me. As Co-founder and President of the XR Society, my primary aim is to make immersive technology accessible to every student who wants to use and learn it – no matter the discipline or background they come from – and to create immersive experiences with a purpose. <br> As an art student I worried that my course would stop me from being able to use this technology (I can’t exactly code!), but I’ve realised it’s done quite the opposite and I cannot wait to learn more alongside other students. I really hope that everyone feels included and welcome to this society. I truly believe it has a place in the future of Leeds Uni and I encourage you to share us with the people around you!"

		"bio": "My journey to XR started last year during a 2-week SSP on ‘Advances in Medical Education’. One particular session focussed on the uses of VR and AR in Anatomy teaching and patient simulation for clinical education, which I felt was incredibly revolutionary and much cooler than the way we are taught now! <br> Fast forward a few months, and I am doing a project looking into the usage of Microsoft HoloLens in Stroke rehab, learning more about the work of our very own Centre for Immersive Technology that we’re so lucky to have in Leeds, and now setting up LUU XR Society! <br> I started reading about XR's uses in medicine, engineering, art, education and psychology. What became apparent is the lack of platforms within universities and on a national level to bring creative students from the various disciplines together, attract academics and engage with the Extended Reality industry in order to speed up the rate of development and implement well-constructed ideas… <br> The future of XR is a beautiful and awe-inspiring one, where the only limit is our collective imagination!"

Such immersion into an experience that would usually only be accessible to genuine pilots with years of practice was incredible for me, and since then I've been following the field closely. As General Secretary I would relish the opportunity to help any students join in and experience this amazing technology, and hopefully spark some interest in those that have never been exposed to XR! <br> Being an Aerospace student, I would love to work with pilots and airline companies to provide a platform for aircraft simulation, and to collaborate on projects that members would be able to work on and potentially be sponsored for!"

With a bit of tinkering I figured out how to play almost any game that could run on my laptop at the time (Minecraft) in VR. <br> I also messed around with making VR games and programs, however the durability of the Google Cardboard is about as good as you would expect from something with cardboard in the name... <br> Since then VR has come a long way, but unfortunately due to the price barriers involved in VR, I haven’t been able to see its full potential. My hopes for Leeds XR Soc, as treasurer, is to make Extended Reality devices more accessible, and get as many people using XR as possible!"

The whole team is grateful to see such engagement during this time. A big thank you from us for all of your support. <br> Over the coming months, moving into the next academic year, we will be engaging with you all and seeing what we can achieve together whilst having fun along the way. As part of my role I will be creating and organising the material for our events and getting you all excited to be a part of the society! <br> So about me, I have a passion for technology and XR is no exception. I can whole heartedly admit that the first 2 hours in VR feels more like 30 minutes, it’s that fun (at least for myself). The Superhot game is a MUST for those wanting to get a taste for an initial immersive VR experience (something I’m sure we can arrange). <br> On the more nitty gritty side of XR technology, I’ll be working with academics and a few students on my summer research project to create solutions for prototyping/designing with AR. Think playing with Lego as a child, but unrestricted... <br> As some of you may know, the technology is still expensive (albeit cheaper more recently). So as part of the Leeds XR society we’ll be looking into bringing the technology to you! As well as allowing us all to really let loose with what is possible and have the excited minds eager to dive in. <br> Are you ready, Player One?"

Being immersed in fantasy worlds and simulations like this is such a unique experience and I would love to be able to work with it more and be able build on that experience. <br> Studying a field as diverse as computer science provides me with a fantastic opportunities to explore related fields and build on my knowledge that I have gained from my degree, and XR technologies is a fast emerging field and provides fantastic opportunities to learn and grow from it. <br> I was particularly keen on becoming the Faculty Rep as I like the interdisciplinary focus of this society – the idea that XR, and other technologies are something which should be accessible to all, not just those who study it; developing an interdisciplinary society seems like a fantastic opportunities for new learning experiences and friendships across faculties. <br> I’m really excited to start building up a team of Faculty Ambassadors to work with and help build up this society and its connections across the uni and within Leeds – I hope to see you there!"

This was amazing for me as I got to test and work with rapidly developing software. It also gave me the chance to see how widely applicable it was! <br> I also got to use haptic feedback pens while using 3D printing software like Rhino and understood it as a sculpting material, which grew very important in my practice as an artist. For my foundation show I virtually recreated museum space to hang my paintings in, but the technology I was using then has already developed so much! <br> I understand I've been very lucky to experience such things and would love others to get to try it too! <br> I look forward to working with everyone, I hope this society will provide fascinating and cutting-edge opportunities that are accessible to everyone!"

Since then, I’ve always kept an eye on what was being done and on the accessibility of the technology. XR brings a new form of human-machine interaction, and therefore new possibilities to what we can do and how we interact with each other. <br> As part of the Events Rep team, I look forward to give students access to XR equipment and the possibility to learn how to develop products with it. Thus, I hope to bring a set of events that allows a range of people from different disciplines to see this society as a platform to develop their ideas and to solve their challenges. <br> I’m excited to what we’ll bring next year, democratising XR and contributing to the development of the technology!"

Being fully immersed in the virtual environment was such a fun and unique experience, and allowed me to explore art in a completely new perspective. Ever since then, I've always been interested as to how the technology can transform the way we learn, live, communicate and connect with others around the world. With the technology becoming increasingly popular, it's exciting to see how it'll be implemented in more mainstream applications in the future. <br> Although I haven't had much experience in XR due to its high price point, I've learnt enough from my degree to understand its full potential to cause a monumental shift across many industries in the coming years. <br> One of the main things that drew me into society is its determination to make these technologies accessible to everyone. It's an inclusive community for students from all disciplines to come together and enjoy the rapidly growing field of XR. As the graphic design rep, I can't wait to be promoting opportunities for students across Leeds to learn and experience more about this exciting technology first hand!"

The new way to view experiences through the use of XR is very exciting, and now it’s developing more than ever. My favourite use of XR is the amazing artwork that talented people are able to produce. <br> In the future I am sure it will be an integral part in most industry and it’ll become an extremely common application within society and the world of work. <br> What’s exciting about this society, and one of the reasons why I joined it, is because they want to make this technology available for everyone to use. It’s an extremely friendly and helpful community to be in and as the social media rep I want to make this society known so as many people as possible can access and experience XR!"

I tried out a prototype VR headset from Sony that showed us a football stadium. It was such a surreal experience, feeling like I was actually right there in the stadium and watching a game. I don't even really like football but this unique experience somehow made it amazing! <br> I think VR provides us with many exciting opportunities for the future, paving the way for a new and super immersive entertainment and educational experiences. Since I haven't had very many VR experiences, I'd love to learn more about it. That is why I'm so glad to be a part of this amazing new society where we can do that. <br> As Project Coordinator, I will have this fantastic opportunity to work with you all and help you pursue your XR dreams through a variety of projects and industrial opportunities. <br> Can't wait to work with the rest of the committee to share these opportunities with you all this year!"
