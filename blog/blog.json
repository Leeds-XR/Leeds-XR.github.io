Thereâ€™s so much more to come today including talks from Leeds XR Societyâ€™s very own Vice President Mohamed Ismail at 9:30am! Also taking the spotlight is post-grad psychology in VR student John Pikavance, and Tilt Brush artist Rosie Summers, whoâ€™s work weâ€™ve recently shared with you guys. <br> As well as being accessible through your standard desktop screen, todayâ€™s events will also use ENGAGE, another VR live-streaming software, so grab those headsets and get immersive! <br> This is the perfect example of how students are going to shape the future of XR, and itâ€™s just the beginning.
